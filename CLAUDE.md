# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is a newly initialized repository. There is currently no code, build system, or project structure in place.

## Getting Started

When beginning development in this repository:

1. Check for a README.md or package.json/requirements.txt/Cargo.toml (or similar) to understand the project type and dependencies
2. Look for build scripts, Makefiles, or task runners in the project root
3. Check for test frameworks and testing conventions in the codebase
4. Review any CI/CD configuration files (.github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml, etc.)

## Notes for Future Updates

As the codebase develops, this file should be updated to include:

- Common build, test, and development commands
- High-level architecture and code organization patterns
- Key design decisions and constraints
- Integration points and external dependencies
